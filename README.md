# plinkoboard
Plinko Board programmed in Java<br/>
Grade 12 Data Management project which simulates a plinko board, in which you drop a ball from the top of the board, which hits pins on the way down around which the ball will either move to the left or to the right. The position of the ball once it reaches the bottom of the board determines how much reward you get. This plinko board program makes the user consider probabilities and which initial position is optimal to obtain the best reward.
